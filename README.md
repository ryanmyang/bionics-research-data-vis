# bionics-research-data-vis
Data visualization and processing for my bionics research lab work


### Setup
0. You need to have `pipenv` and `python3` in order to easily install the dependencies. [Pipenv Link](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)
1. Clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/ryanmyang/bionics-research-data-vis.git`
2. `cd` into this folder `bionics-research-data-vis`
3. Run `pipenv shell` to create a virtual environment for the project
4. Run `pipenv install` to automatically install the packages

### Motorlearning Visualization:
Run `motor_learning.py` with `python3 motor_learning.py` or `python motor_learning.py` depending on how you have python installed.
To change the file, scroll to the bottom and swap out the file name in the main function.

### Reachable Workspace:
W.I.P, `data_vis.py` is working though for now.
